    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Bradford Arnold, a designer and maker based in Texas. By day I study at the University of Texas at Arlington; in my free time I volunteer at the UTA Fab Lab, teach pattern drafting, and pursue hands‑on engineering projects. My work blends three passions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modern craft</strong> – I use digital tools like Seamly2D for pattern drafting and CNC machines for wood and metal fabrication, then translate those designs into physical objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable engineering</strong> – I’m building a low‑cost aquaponics sensor suite that monitors pH, temperature and total dissolved solids in real time. The data will power a web dashboard and support a paper on accessible 200‑liter tank designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional heritage</strong> – I study historical tailoring texts and adapt early 20th‑century pattern‑cutting methods for today’s makers. This research has shaped the standardized jeans and trucker‑jacket patterns I teach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upcoming projects include CNC‑plasma‑cut Chinese vegetable knives and spatulas with hand‑turned handles, and a maple‑framed cloud chamber with upgraded Peltier coolers for more efficient particle tracking. Whether I’m coding sensors, turning a wooden grip on a lathe or drafting a pair of jeans, I’m driven by curiosity and by the desire to make craft more accessible.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer Programme</h2>
        <p>At the University of Texas at Arlington’s Fab Lab I run a free programme that guides beginners through every step of making their own jeans or a classic Type III‑style trucker jacket. By combining early 20th‑century tailoring theory with modern digital tools we lower the barriers to entry and honour the craft’s history. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Draft the sloper:</strong> Students take their measurements and use Seamly2D to draft a basic trouser or shirt sloper. I explain each equation and demonstrate tools like perpendicular and angle lines as we draw the waistband and panels.</li>
            <li><strong>Convert to a garment pattern:</strong> We adapt the sloper into a jeans pattern or a Type III‑inspired trucker jacket, drawing on historic texts such as the <em>Blue Book of Men’s Tailoring</em> and Müller &amp; Sohn. Researching the evolution from 19th‑century French chore coats to Levi’s Type I, II and III jackets informs our designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Laser‑cut the muslin prototype:</strong> After finalising the draft we export the pattern to SVG/DXF and cut a muslin prototype using the Fab Lab’s large‑format laser cutter. Over countless tests I’ve refined power and speed settings so muslin and denim cut cleanly without scorching.</li>
            <li><strong>Fit and adjust:</strong> Students sew the muslin, evaluate the fit and tweak the pattern as needed – deepening armholes, adjusting leg panels or adding missing sections. New patterns are prototyped until they’re accurate.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut Cone Denim:</strong> Once the fit is right we laser‑cut the final fabric. Sponsorship from Cone Denim means participants can access premium denim at no cost, reinforcing the programme’s accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Sew the final garment:</strong> In the Fab Lab we construct the finished piece: top‑stitching, attaching pockets and finishing seams. We document each project with photos and notes so others can follow along.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cone’s fabric will be used primarily in this volunteer programme, enabling students and faculty to draft, laser‑cut and sew their own garments. The denim will also support future classes and workshops exploring the intersection of heritage craftsmanship and modern making. Outside the studio I document techniques and share patterns and videos online so makers everywhere can experiment with Cone fabrics for personal projects.</p>

                <h3>Automated Aquaponics Sensor Suite</h3>
                <p>I’m developing a low‑cost monitoring system for a 200‑liter aquaponics tank. Using open‑source hardware the system measures pH, temperature and total dissolved solids in real time. A custom web application will display live readings and graph 24‑hour trends so I can identify fluctuations throughout the day. I plan to publish a guide detailing how to build the sensor suite and how to adapt the tank design for collegiate or personal use.</p>

                <h3>CNC‑Cut Kitchen Tools</h3>
                <p>With the Fab Lab’s CNC plasma cutter I’m fabricating a series of food‑safe steel kitchen tools. The project includes Chinese vegetable knives and spatulas cut from 16‑gauge sheet. I’ll use the CNC lathe to turn intricate grips for the knives, sharpen blades on the belt sander at a 10‑degree tilt and build wooden handles for the spatulas using traditional woodworking techniques. One challenge I’m exploring is how to evenly bend the steel to form the spatula curves.</p>

                <h3>Maple‑Framed Cloud Chamber</h3>
                <p>My current cloud chamber loses too much cold through its metal frame. I’m designing a 25 × 25 cm frame from maple to improve insulation and aesthetics. Paired with higher‑quality Peltier coolers and temperature probes, the wooden frame should minimize temperature loss from the cold plate while creating a more beautiful object. The new design will make it easier to observe particle tracks for longer periods.</p>

    <section id="documentation">
        <h2>Documentation &amp; Videos</h2>
        <p>I’m creating a series of videos and written guides that walk through pattern drafting, laser cutting and garment construction. Before filming I write a script outlining the order of operations, which measurements to take, the formulas to use and when to introduce each tool in Seamly2D. These resources are designed to maximise retention and minimise barriers to entry – anyone can learn to draft and sew their own jeans.</p>
        <p>Use the placeholders below to embed your own tutorial videos when they’re ready. For example, you might include a video introduction that covers the basics of drafting a pants pattern and using Seamly2D. Simply replace the <code>src</code> attribute with the path to your own video file.</p>
